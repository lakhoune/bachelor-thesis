These practices are thus the property of a kind of community created over time by the sustained pursuit of shared enterprise.

  abstract = {Research shows a gap in terms of requirements elicitation between developers and endusers. Due to the low technical expertise of some members of online communities, they often cannot collaborate efficiently with developers and cannot provide continuous feedback during application development processes. However, collaborative modeling processes can play an important role in education, enforcing best-practices, support rapid prototyping and lower the communication and collaboration barriers between developers and end-users. This paper presents a tool for collaborative modeling of Web applications in near real-time and their automatic generation. Early evaluation with end-users in simulated community settings show promising results for the interplay of modeling and collaboration in requirements gathering and Web application design and development. We claim that near real-time modeling on the Web has the potential to bring together stakeholders during design and development and offers a new perspective on model-based Web Engineering.},

  abstract    = {Standardized interfaces are the connecting link of today's distributed systems, facilitating access to data services in the cloud. REST APIs have been prevalent over the last years, despite several issues like over- and underfetching of resources. GraphQL enjoys rapid adoption, resolving these problems by using statically typed queries. However, the redevelopment of services to the new paradigm is costly. Therefore, several approaches for the successive migration from REST to GraphQL have been proposed, many leveraging OpenAPI service descriptions. In this article, we present the findings of our empirical evaluation on the APIs.guru directory and identify several schema translation challenges. These include less expressive schema types in GraphQL, as well as missing meta information about related resources in OpenAPI. To this end, we developed the open source Link Generator, that analyzes OpenAPI documents and automatically adds links to increase translation utility. This fundamentally benefits around 34{\%} of APIs in the APIs.guru directory. Our findings and tool support contribute to the ongoing discussion about the migration of REST APIs to GraphQL, and provide developers with valuable insights into common pitfalls, to reduce friction during API transformation.},

These concepts come from divergent traditions: the former has its roots in knowledge management and the latter comes from agricultural knowledge systems and soft-systems analysis. Although stemming from different strands of thinking, there are some common concepts and common elements. For both approaches, the characteristics, theoretical background and importance for development are explored. Next, similarities based on conceptions of social learning are explored. Finally, it is argued that communities of practice and networks for learning are part of the same continuum with varying degrees of formality, ranging from informal communities of practice to highly formal networks for learning.},

  abstract = {Purpose
            -- This paper aims to identify the success factors of communities of practice (CoPs) that will improve knowledge creation (KC) in educational organizations. Today, educational organizations are faced with constant changes in their environment. These changes have forced organizations to view their human capital as knowledge capital to survive and thrive. CoPs can be one of the most important factors to achieve these goals, and it should be considered by educational organizations.
            Design/methodology/approach
            -- The present paper tries to identify the success factors of CoPs and examine the impact of the success factors of CoPs in KC. The research method is descriptive. The population of the research consists of students of Payame Noor University as a case study. A questionnaire based on experts' opinion was designed and more than 35 articles were reviewed. Factor analysis was used to categorize and examine the correlation between success factors of CoPs and KC and, finally, the regression equation based on correlation' result was formed.
            Findings
            -- The results showed six success factors: ``organization'', ``optimizing interactions'', ``infrastructure'', ``supporting tools'', ``strategy and goals'' and ``organizational support''. These factors reflect the effective factors in educational organizations attempting to progress in KC should focus. Among these success factors, ``strategy and goals'' and ``organization'' have the highest effect on CoPs in this case.
            Research limitations/implications
            -- The paper discusses how the success factors of CoPs improve KC in universities as educational organization and how an organization will benefit from these factors. It can help the development of guidelines for educational organizations to increase their community knowledge information. They can also apply the findings of this research to promote the scientific level of their related organizations through reinforcement of CoP practices. In this paper, the authors faced some problems to collect expert's opinion and also gather the questionnaires.
            Originality/value
            -- This paper may have great value to researchers, as well as practitioners involved in knowledge-creation programs in organizations about CoPs and the knowledge-creation field. This research can establish guidelines for Payame Noor University Tehran-North as a case study using the right policies and make changes to the traditional structures of the university, improve and develop the knowledge-creation process and the formation of CoPs. This study can guide managers and, especially, the university managers to provide suitable base to shape COPs, help them emerge and enhance them effectively.},

  abstract  = {Community Information Systems (CIS) are information systems using a variety of Internet engineering technologies to support Communities of Practice (CoP). In contrast to organizational information systems supporting defined organizational structures, CIS depend a complex interplay of informal and evolving CoP structures, evolving technology and the mostly hidden rules of network structures. Therefore, CIS need the possibility to reflect about their development processes and to elicit the networks roles and structures. The advent of the Web 2.0 generates even more demands on CIS, since most business models rely on the networking of people to achieve goals set by the communitites. My research has contributed to existing research areas connected to information systems engineering, but also to the development of emerging research disciplines like Web Science. In Web Science both engineering and science play important roles in understanding the Web as a social graph and to design for a desired behaviour. In addition to a comprehensive survey of literature on CIS, the main contributions of the thesis are the following:

A methodology called ATLAS for the engineering of CIS based on continuous elicitation and assessment of community needs, the reflection on social roles in communities of practice and a socio-technical information system development process incorporating the communities as stakeholders.

A service-oriented architecture called LAS for the realization of reflective community information systems by measuring, analyzing, and simulating the use of information systems.

A model and a repository for community-centered cross-media social network analysis called the MediaBase



These contribution have beed developed and evaluated in a lot of projects and case studies. Main results are reported here while details are given in the papers accumulated here.},

Long-tail communities need to reflect and develop awareness for the success of community-specific IS (CIS) artifacts in their particular practice context in an ongoing manner. In community-oriented DSR, researchers participate as active community members contributing CIS success awareness with the help of CIS success models resulting from ongoing CIS evaluation. However, CIS success awareness is challenging to achieve compared to organizational IS due to diversity, dynamicity, informal structures and permeable boundaries. In this paper, we emphasize the benefits of ongoing CIS success awareness with the help of custom-tailored CIS success models in community-oriented DSR contexts.

  abstract = {A large number of studies have been conducted during the last decade and a half attempting to identify those factors that contribute to information systems success. However, the dependent variable in these studies---I/S success---has been an elusive one to define. Different researchers have addressed different aspects of success, making comparisons difficult and the prospect of building a cumulative tradition for I/S research similarly elusive. To organize this diverse research, as well as to present a more integrated view of the concept of I/S success, a comprehensive taxonomy is introduced. This taxonomy posits six major dimensions or categories of I/S success---SYSTEM QUALITY, INFORMATION QUALITY, USE, USER SATISFACTION, INDIVIDUAL IMPACT, and ORGANIZATIONAL IMPACT. Using these dimensions, both conceptual and empirical studies are then reviewed (a total of 180 articles are cited) and organized according to the dimensions of the taxonomy. Finally, the many aspects of I/S success are drawn together into a descriptive model and its implications for future I/S research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Success is found relatively rare in the world of software projects. One possible reason may be the difference in the perception of the meaning of `success' in the minds of people who evaluate the project performance. Usually, stakeholders external to the project organization use target cost and time for inferring `project success' while those internal to project agree that the attainment of `scope' of development decides the `project success'. Hence, project success criteria, as believed by different groups of stakeholders, do not match. In this study, we examine the views of one such internal set of stakeholders: Programmer/Developers, Project Managers and Customer Account Managers. We conducted an exploratory survey to determine their view of a successful project. We found surprising uniformity in different constituents of this particular group of stakeholders and all of them overwhelmingly considered meeting the `scope' of software projects, which comprises the functionality and quality of the project outcome, as the highest determinant of success. We believe that this view of software project success in the eyes of software professionals should be studied further to build a comprehensive project evaluation framework and should be utilized effectively to achieve success in terms of external objectives like customer satisfaction and customer happiness.},

  abstract = {Natural language processing (NLP) is a theory-motivated range of computational techniques for the automatic analysis and representation of human language. NLP research has evolved from the era of punch cards and batch processing (in which the analysis of a sentence could take up to 7 minutes) to the era of Google and the likes of it (in which millions of webpages can be processed in less than a second). This review paper draws on recent developments in NLP research to look at the past, present, and future of NLP technology in a new light. Borrowing the paradigm of `jumping curves' from the field of business management and marketing prediction, this survey article reinterprets the evolution of NLP research as the intersection of three overlapping curves-namely Syntactics, Semantics, and Pragmatics Curveswhich will eventually lead NLP research to evolve into natural language understanding.},

This versatility is achieved by trying to avoid task-specific engineering and therefore disregarding a lot of prior knowledge. Instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. This work is then used as a basis for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements.},

  abstract = {This paper gives an overview of impersonation bots that generate output in one, or possibly, multiple modalities. We also discuss rapidly advancing areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence that could lead to frighteningly powerful new multi-modal social bots. Our main conclusion is that most commonly known bots are one dimensional (i.e., chatterbot), and far from deceiving serious interrogators. However, using recent advances in machine learning, it is possible to unleash incredibly powerful, human-like armies of social bots, in potentially well coordinated campaigns of deception and influence.},

  abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest.   The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them.  Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Freund and Schapire[1996]), but are more robust with respect to noise.  Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting.  Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

  abstract  = {While bots have been around for many decades, recent technological advancements and the increasing adoption of language-based communication platforms have led to a surge of new software bots, which have become increasingly pervasive in our everyday lives. Although many novel bots are being designed and deployed, the terms used to describe them and their properties are vast, diverse, and often inconsistent. Even the concept of what is or is not a bot is unclear. This hinders our ability to study, understand, design, and classify bots. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of software bots, which focuses on the observable properties and behaviours of software bots, as well as the environments where bots are deployed and designed. We see this taxonomy as a focal point for a discussion in our community so that together we can deeply consider how to evaluate and understand existing bots, as well as how we may design more innovative and productive bots.},

  abstract = {We study response selection for multi-turn conversation in retrieval-based chatbots. Existing work either concatenates utterances in context or matches a response with a highly abstract context vector finally, which may lose relationships among utterances or important contextual information. We propose a sequential matching network (SMN) to address both problems. SMN first matches a response with each utterance in the context on multiple levels of granularity, and distills important matching information from each pair as a vector with convolution and pooling operations. The vectors are then accumulated in a chronological order through a recurrent neural network (RNN) which models relationships among utterances. The final matching score is calculated with the hidden states of the RNN. An empirical study on two public data sets shows that SMN can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods for response selection in multi-turn conversation.},

This paper presents a detailed review on current social bots and proper techniques that can be used to fly under the radar of OSNs defences to be undetectable for long periods of time. We also suggest a refined taxonomy of detection approaches from social network perspective, as well as commonly used datasets and their corresponding findings.

  abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that a growing amount of social media content is generated by autonomous entities known as social bots. In this work we present a framework to detect such entities on Twitter. We leverage more than a thousand features extracted from public data and meta-data about users: friends, tweet content and sentiment, network patterns, and activity time series. We benchmark the classification framework by using a publicly available dataset of Twitter bots. This training data is enriched by a manually annotated collection of active Twitter users that include both humans and bots of varying sophistication. Our models yield high accuracy and agreement with each other and can detect bots of different nature. Our estimates suggest that between 9{\%} and 15{\%} of active Twitter accounts are bots. Characterizing ties among accounts, we observe that simple bots tend to interact with bots that exhibit more human-like behaviors. Analysis of content flows reveals retweet and mention strategies adopted by bots to interact with different target groups. Using clustering analysis, we characterize several subclasses of accounts, including spammers, self promoters, and accounts that post content from connected applications.},

@phdthesis{Renz16,
  abstract  = {Facilitated by modern networked ICT, people around the world organize in self-sustaining communities of practice (CoP) across professional domains and organizational boundaries. Communities thereby pursue the main goal to learn how to do better. With today's trend for mass individualization, we find a vast number and diversity of small professional niche communities in the long tail, apart from few large communities in the mainstream of the Web. As prerequisite for sustained success, communities must constantly stay aware of quality and impact of their community information systems (CIS). With fast-paced emergent technological and social progress, communities must develop agency to decide which tools best support them and why. While data-driven enterprises spend considerable technical and human resources in sophisticated business intelligence and analytics (BI{\&}A) solutions for such decisions, communities face a real challenge, given their inherent resource scarcity. In meritocratic communities, a shared notion of CIS success must be negotiated from multiple specific, sometimes conflicting and idiosyncratic stakeholder perceptions of CIS success existing in a community. Standard positivist BI{\&}A approaches with myopic focus on financial outcomes lack support for such inherently anti-positivist negotiation processes. Communities require respective support for CIS success awareness in terms of methodology, formalization, and technical infrastructure. As solution to this problem, this dissertation presents MobSOS, a framework for CIS success awareness, tailored to the ontological properties of professional long tail CoP. From a methodological point of view, MobSOS extends a community-oriented design science research methodology by an explicit notion for CIS success modeling as essential part of evaluation. CIS success models play the central role of fluid digital media operationalizing negotiation. From a technical point of view, MobSOS pursues an integrative approach to extend contemporary Web and P2P-based CIS platforms by CIS success awareness with the help of a CIS success modeling toolkit. Based on a comprehensive formalization framework, MobSOS supports operations such as monitoring, assessing, exploring, modeling, measuring, visualizing, validating, sharing, and negotiating different stakeholder notions of CIS success in a community-wide discourse. In the context of several national and international research projects, we successfully applied MobSOS in communities with varying scopes in domains such as health care, multimedia management, and technology-enhanced learning. Typical advanced CIS success models include few, yet highly relevant and effective success factors. They are well-balanced combinations of universal vs. community-tailored success factors and metrics. In particular, we note that CIS success models with full coverage for both quality and impact and focused scope are more useful than models with myopic single-dimension focus and a vague scope. Awareness on CIS quality and impact brings communities agency in form of a better informed decision on CIS tool selection, use or active development. We could demonstrate that CIS success models contributed to determine ideal software configurations, to estimate development efforts, to identify and eliminate bottlenecks, to elicit hidden requirements, or to judge concrete impact on the community. MobSOS also proved as effective learning analytics framework to identify learning patterns, to detect usage anomalies, or to measure learning progress. Our technical evaluations finally show, that MobSOS is an effective, performant, and low-cost open-source framework for CIS success awareness.},
