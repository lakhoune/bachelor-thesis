    abstract = {Learning is becoming an urgent topic. Nations worry about the learning of their citizens, companies about the learning of their workers, schools about the learning of their students. But it is not always easy to think about how to foster learning in innovative ways. This book presents a framework for doing that, with a social theory of learning that is ground-breaking yet accessible, with profound implications not only for research, but also for all those who have to foster learning as part of their responsibilites at work, at home, at school.},

    abstract = {Conventional customer service chatbots
            are usually based on human dialogue, yet
            significant issues in terms of data scale and
            privacy. In this paper, we present SuperAgent, a customer service chatbot that leverages large-scale and publicly available ecommerce data. Distinct from existing            counterparts, SuperAgent takes advantage
            of data from in-page product descriptions
            as well as user-generated content from ecommerce websites, which is more practical and cost-effective when answering
            repetitive questions, freeing up human
            support staff to answer much higher value
            questions. We demonstrate SuperAgent as
            an add-on extension to mainstream web
            browsers and show its usefulness to user's
            online shopping experience.},
