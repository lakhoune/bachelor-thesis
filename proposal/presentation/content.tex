\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}


\begin{frame}{Motivation}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Rise of World Wide Web led to better communication
    \item Place to meet and exchange information easily
    \item Researches took this opportunity to transform Communities of Practice into online Communities of Practice (CoPs)
          \begin{itemize}
            \item World-wide collaboration
          \end{itemize}
          %researchers in particular from all over the world can collaborate more easily 
          %what Cops are will be discussed in more detail later.
    \item A CoP is only sustainable, if members continuously provide innovation efforts \cite{RKJa15}
    \item Therefore members need to be aware of their successes and failures
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Motivation}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Success of CoP relies on success factors
    \item It is difficult to measure and evaluate success
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Factors are changing over time \cite{Renz08}
            \item Domain-specific success factors
          \end{itemize}
    \item Time consuming
    \item Traditional success modeling systems automate success evaluation
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Not optimized for collaboration
            \item Do not take mobility into consideration \cite{Renz08}
          \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Motivation}
  %this is why some continuous success modeling systems have been developed
  %however, the problem is that
  Social Networks and chat platforms are used for information exchange
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Familiar and intuitive
    \item Real-time collaboration
    \item Optimized for mobile devices
  \end{itemize}
  %This shows how chat platforms could adress the aforementionted issues
\end{frame}


\subsection{Thesis Goals}

\begin{frame}{Thesis Goals}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Design a chatbot for success modeling and visualizations
          inside Community Information Systems (CIS)
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Bot should communicate with MobSOS (CCA) %framework
            \item Should be deployed with the Social Bot Framework
          \end{itemize}
    \item Find out how the bot affects collaboration and success awareness of the commmunity %in contrast to traditional web frontends
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{State of the Art}

\subsection{Social Bots}
\begin{frame}{Social Bots and Chatbots}

\begin{frame}{Social Bots and Chatbots}
  \begin{block}{Definition}
    ``A social bot is a computer algorithm that automatically produces content and interacts with humans on social media, \dots'' \cite{FVD*16b}
  \end{block}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Can be used for automation  %e.g. Alexa Smart Home, Shopping lists Reminders
    \item Users interact with Bots by voice or chat %in the case of chat: Chatbots
    \item Provide better user experience, as they are more intuitive to use
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Succes in Communities of Practice}
\begin{frame}{Communities of Practice}
  \begin{block}{Definition}
    ``Communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern or a
    passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.'' \cite{Weng98}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Communities of Practice}
  \begin{block}{Definition}
    ``Communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern or a
    passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.'' \cite{Weng98}
  \end{block}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item CoPs are diverse communities, which study a certain domain
    \item Informal structures with permeable boundaries \cite{RKJa15}
          %informal structures: This means that there are no strict rules about the hierarchy inside a community and they do not follow the same structure as traditional organizations
          %Permeable boundaries: This means that it is not clearly defined which members belong to the CoP and which don't
    \item CoPs contain sub-commmunities which can be overlapping
          % members can belong to more than one community
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Members of a Communitiy of Practice}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Have various roles
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Researchers
            \item Professionals
            \item Students
            \item Hobbyists
          \end{itemize} %DBIS and ACIS as an example????
    \item Have different degrees of
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Knowledge %Researchers > students
            \item Interest %Professionals > Hobbyists
            \item Contribution
                  \begin{itemize}
                    \item Core Members %do most of the contribution 
                    \item Lurkers %only consume but almost no contribution
                          %study on open Source found that for random projects 22percent contribute. For the top 500 projects: ~90percent don't contribute -> 1% (90-9-1) rule
                  \end{itemize}
          \end{itemize}
    \item Do not have to belong to the same organization
    \item Share their work through social interaction e.g. online Social Networks %in this case we also talk about an online CoP
  \end{itemize}

                \item Adjust to current trends
              \end{itemize}
              %Success seems to be a very abstract metric so in order to measure it we build a success model
        \item Measurement of Success through a \emph{Success Model}
        \item Success model distinct for each community
              %based on the goals that they want to achieve

\section{Concept}
\subsection{Use Case}
\begin{frame}{Mensa Communities}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Community of people frequently visiting the mensa
    \item Community consists of students and university employees
    \item Similar to the concept of Community of Practice %share a concern: food at the canteen. And Interact regularly: Students argumenting on which mensa is the best?? Freqwuent visits to mensa
    \item Different community levels:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Top level: all mensa frequenteers in Germany
            \item Intermediate level: all mensa frequenteers for a University
            \item Low level: individual circle of friends, which frequent the canteen together %Members can belong to different circles of friends->overlapping
          \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}



% \begin{frame}{Mensa Bot}
%   For this community a chatbot is designed, which can be used to
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item Get the menu for a canteen
%     \item Rate meals
%     \item Query success visualizations for meals, canteens and other success metrics, which can be designed by the community
%   \end{itemize}
%   The chatbot is deployed with Slack.

    \item Divide into groups of 2-3 students
          \begin{itemize}
            \item make visualization requests
            \item update the success model
          \end{itemize}
          Use MobSOS CCA frontend and new chatbot
    \item Hand out questionnaire covering collaboration and success awareness
