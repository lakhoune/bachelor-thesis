\chapter{Introduction}
Community Information Systems (CIS) help Communities of Practice (CoPs) in structuring their work. They help such communities by offering tools to coordinate and evaluate different tasks within the community.

On the other hand chatbots can be used to assist CoPs by offering an intuitive interface to users. Users can perform various tasks with varying degree of complexity, through the use of chat. This reduces the complexity of those tasks, which makes it easy to use even for non-experienced users.

\section{Motivation}
We want to continiously evaluate our systems. However those evaluations are time-consuming and require data management experts. The question arises how we can automate the evaluation process and provide an easy to use interface, such that Communities of Practice (CoP) can easily implement this into existing systems.
To provide such an interface the use of chatbots seems a viable option.
