\chapter{Introduction}
Community Information Systems (CIS) help Communities of Practice (CoPs) in structuring their work. They help such communities by offering tools to coordinate and evaluate different tasks within the community.

On the other hand chatbots can be used to assist CoPs by offering an intuitive interface to users. Users can perform various tasks with varying degree of complexity, through the use of chat. This reduces the complexity of those tasks, which makes it easy to use even for non-experienced users.

\section{Motivation}
The rise of the world wide web, gave birth to the concept of online communities, which introduces social interactions on the web. It was now possible for users to meet, interact and contribute on the web \cite{Renz08}, much like in real world communities.

The success of online communities relies on various internal and external factors, such as the active participation of its members, or the general interest in the field.

Success is a dynamic process, as various success metrics might change over time \cite{Renz08}. This is why we need to continiously evaluate the community in order predict future developments and challenges. However those evaluations are often time-consuming and require data-management experts. Automating the evaluation process and providing an intuitive interface, helps small Communities of Practice (CoP) implement continious success evaluations into their existing systems, which in return helps them find ways to improve the community \cite{Renz08}.

Current success modeling techniques are often provided as a complicated web-interface, which requires some technical know-how to use them. Furthermore success modeling is a social task, in which members of the commmunity should be included, but current web interfaces are often not optimized for collaboration.

On the other hand social networks, and chats in general have been a popular tool for information exchange inside a community. Using a bot inside such a system provides an interface, which is easier to learn and seams more natural to non-trained users. Furthermore, using a social bot inside the chat does not require members to change the medium. This means that they can create the success model, while still discussing it with other members inside the chat-group.

\section{Thesis Goals}

The goal of this thesis is to create a social bot, which can be used to define and visualize success models for existing las2peer services. The social bot should provide an interface to communicate with the MobSOS Continious Community Analytics system.

The bot should be deployed with the Social Bot Framework and end users should be able to add the bot to a chat platform, such as Slack. The bot should be able to be integrated in group conversations in order to allow collaboration between different members of a community.

Overall, the goal is to design a service, which combines the MobSOS framework with the Social Bot Framework, such that members of communities can easily be integrated in the development process of the success model, which in turn increases the overall success awareness of the community.
