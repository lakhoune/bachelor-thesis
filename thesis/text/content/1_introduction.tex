\chapter{Introduction}
Community Information Systems (CIS) help Communities of Practice (CoPs) in structuring their work by offering tools to coordinate and evaluate different tasks within the community.
A CoP consists of members with various degrees of knowledge and interest in the field.
Researchers are the core members of the CoP.
They contribute to the \emph{success awareness} of the CoP with the help of so-called CIS \emph{success models} \cite{Klam10c}.
Technical know-how is required to modify those success models, thus hindering the participation of less experienced members
% , like students or hobbyists, 
in the development process.

Meanwhile, chatbots are offering an intuitive interface to perform tasks with varying degrees of complexity. 
Therefore, the use of chatbots could increase the \emph{success awareness} non-core members, which increases the overall success awareness of the CoP.

\section{Motivation}
The rise of the World Wide Web allowed researchers to collaborate more easily. Researchers from all over the world can meet and exchange information more easily. A community of researchers studying a particular domain is referred to as (online) Community of Practice (CoP) \cite{Renz08}.

The success of CoPs relies on various internal and external factors, such as the active participation of its members or the general interest in the field.

The evaluation of success is described as a dynamic process, as various needs of a CoP are changing over time \cite{Renz08,GKJa08}.
Thus, the CoP needs to be evaluated continuously to predict future challenges and opportunities.

Nonetheless, such evaluations are often time-consuming. Automating the evaluation process and providing an intuitive interface helps Communities of Practice (CoP) implement continuous success evaluations into existing CIS, which in return helps them find ways to improve the community \cite{Renz08}.

\emph{Success modelling} is the process of describing the success of a CIS with the help of a model. 
Current success modeling techniques are complicated web interfaces, which require technical know-how to use them.

On the other hand, success modeling is a social process in which all community members should participate. However, current web interfaces are often not optimized for collaboration.

Furthermore, the use of smartphones has not been taken into consideration by classic web interfaces.
Thus, new interfaces are required, which cope with the form factor of hand-held devices. Those interfaces need to provide simple and intuitive collaboration possibilities to include all community members in the success evaluation process. 

\section{Thesis Goals}

Social networks are a popular tool for information exchange and social interaction inside a community.
Using a chatbot inside a CIS as an interface is easier to learn and seems more natural to non-experienced users.
Chat platforms are optimized for smartphones and other hand-held devices. Therefore, the use of chatbots might address the preceding issues.

Accordingly, we created a social bot to define and visualize \emph{success models} for existing CIS. The social bot provides an interface to communicate with the Mobile Community Information System Oracle for Success (MobSOS) system.

The bot was modeled with the Social Bot Framework and deployed with the las2peer Social Bot Manager. Users can add the bot to a chat platform that allows bots, such as Slack or Telegram.
The bot can be integrated into group conversations to allow members of a community to collaborate more easily.

The main focus is to combine the MobSOS framework with the Social Bot Framework. We want to determine if such a service improves the communities' collaboration and \emph{success awareness}.
