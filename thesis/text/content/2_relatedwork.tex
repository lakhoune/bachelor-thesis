\chapter{State of the Art}
This chapter provides an overview of the concepts and technologies which are important in the field of my current work. First in Section \ref{lab:background} we define domain-specific terms. In Section \ref{lab:systems}, we describe the systems, which will be used for this thesis.

\section{Background} \label{lab:background}

This section gives a brief introduction to the concepts, which are relevant to the implementation part of this thesis.

\subsection{Social Bots and Chatbots}
Bots are interfaces, which provide automated services to end-users.
In contrast to normal computer programs, bots can use the same services and perform the same actions as human users. Those actions include browsing webpages or issuing API calls.
Bots, which are interacting with users in a conversational manner, are called social bots.
The definition of a social bot is provided by \cite{FVD*16b}:
\begin{quote}
    ``A social bot is a computer algorithm that automatically produces content and interacts with humans on social media, [...]''
\end{quote}

Social bots are getting more and more popular in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), by integrating automation into the daily lives of people \cite{BFPN17}. Users can interact with a social bot through a dedicated channel, such as the chat functionality of a social network.
Social bots, which use chats to interact with users are called chatbots, or conversational bots \cite{WWX*16,AAA17}.
Chatbots have recently become very popular in the context of customer care \cite{CHW*17,FVD*16b}, where they act as virtual assistants, which can answer simple questions \cite{CaWh14} or perform predefined tasks. Their simplicity allows even non-experienced users to perform actions of various degrees of difficulty. 
Chatbots can assist companies in customer service. This allows the staff to concentrate on less mundane issues with customers and therefore increases the effectiveness of the service while keeping costs low. \cite{AAA17}

% Chatbots can be classified into chit-chat chatbots, or task-oriented bots.
% A chit-chat bot engages users into interesting conversations and focusses more on the actual conversation. Task-oriented bots are focused on getting certain actions done. As soon as the desired action is done, the bot will stop the conversation. 

We can distinguish between retrieval based chatbots and generic chatbots \cite{NLKl19,WWX*16}.
Retrieval based bots are focussed on getting specific tasks done and focus less on engaging in a coherent conversation.
Retrieval based chatbots measure the similarity of user queries to candidate responses and run the task that is defined for that response.
They do this by using natural language processing techniques.

Generic chatbots on the other hand also produce generic responses.
An advantage of the generic chatbots is that they provide a better user experience as users can interact more naturally with them than with retrieval based chatbots.

Chatbots provide a better user experience \cite{CHW*17}, because the user is not required to memorize commands in order to get the desired results.
This means that even non-trained users can use such chatbots.
From such a standpoint, it becomes clear why such chatbots are desirable as assistants, as they provide a familiar environment for users to interact with.

\subsubsection{Natural Language Understanding}
Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which tries to make computer programs understand the semantics of human language.
It does this by transforming a block of input text into a data structure that is programmer-friendly but still describes the original meaning of the text \cite{CWB*11}.

Most NLU algorithms these days only look at the syntacticts of words, which relies on statistical features, such as word occurence frequency \cite{CaWh14}.
However humans take far more information into consideration, as the reading of a word triggers a whole bunch of related concepts and experiences which are combined to give the understanding of a text.

Computers try to close this knowledge gap with computational models, which emulate human cognitive processing.
By evaluating the results of those models for a given input, researchers can incrementally improve the accuracy of the model. \cite{CaWh14}
NLU is a domain that is a key research topic for companies like Google and Facebook. \cite{AAA17}


\subsection{Communities of Practice}
A Community of Practice (CoP) is a special kind of community consisting of members studying a certain domain.
The definition of a CoP is given by \cite{Weng98}:
\begin{quote}
    ``
    Communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.''
\end{quote}

In contrast to traditional knowledge systems, where the learner passively receives his information, the learner is actively participating in the community by volountarily sharing his knowledge with other members of the community \cite{AMMi15,Kern08}.
The advantage of CoPs is that they make the learning process easier \cite{SaAr05} and the transfer of knowledge faster \cite{CuZe05}.

Members of a CoP have different degrees of knowledge of the domain.
For example a student has less knowledge than a researcher in a specific domain.
Furthermore, members have various degrees of interest in the practice of the community.
Members with a lot of interest in that domain tend to know more about it and tend to contribute more to the community.
Such members are called \emph{core members} of the community.
Members, which are less active in the community are called \emph{lurkers}.

Members of CoPs do not have to belong to the same organization, but rather participate in common work through social interactions \cite{Weng98}. In the case of an online CoP this could be an online social network \cite{CuZe05}. CoPs can be overlapping and multiple communities can exist inside a single CoP.

\subsection{Measurement of Success}
In order to justify their existence, communities have to constantly be aware of their successes and failures in order to improve their work and adjust to current needs.
A general model for success does not exist, as communities are very diverse, dynamic and informal structures with permeable boundaries.
The members of the community thus can be active participators in the community success modeling, as the success factors are relevant to the practice of the community members \cite{RKJa15}.

In order to cope with dynamic changes, the community must continuously adjust success factors of the success model to satisfy current needs. Success factors can be internal aspects, like project duration, cost and qualitity, as well as external aspects, like customer satisfaction \cite{AgRa06}.

It is important to note, that a project can be evaluated from different perspectives \cite{RKJa15}, e.g. the developers, the customers or the end-users.
In each of these perspectives, each dimension of success can be more, or less, important.
DeLone and McLean \cite{DeMc92} base their model on six different interdependant measures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item System Qualitity: metrics that describe the technical specifations of the system, such as service response time and scalability.
    \item Information Quality: metrics about content qualitity, such as understandability and conciseness.
    \item Use: metrics about how a system is used, such as the regularity of use by a certain user or for the whole community.
    \item User Satisfaction: includes metrics which measure user experience and is thereby largely subjective.
    \item Individual Impact: metrics about how a user adapts to the system over time, such as task performance.
    \item Organizational (Community) Impact: metrics about how the system influences the organization (or community) over time.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}
In order to collect data for the metrics, one should follow the principle \cite{RKJa15}:
\begin{quotation}
    ``observe, where possible; only survey,	where inevitable''
\end{quotation}

\subsection{MobSOS}
The MobSOS framework is a tool, which assists online communities in monitoring and evaluating services. The MobSOS success model extends the classical D\&M IS success model by adding feature aspects which were not covered initially, such as Qualitity of Service and mobility \cite{Renz08}.
The MobSOS Success Modeling concept is described as an iterative process.

The MobSOS Continuous Community Analytics (CCA) system extends the MobSOS framework by providing visualizations of MobSOS data and the ability to add more databases, which can be used for success modeling.

\subsection{Mediabase}
Storing Web 2.0 data is a challenging task due to the variety of different non-interoperable formats.
Mediabase is a concept that has been proposed to store Web 2.0 data in a dynamic way by delivering an analyisis environment for Web Science data sets \cite{KlPe08}.
Mediabase uses graphs to model generated data.
The nodes in those graphs are called \emph{Actors} and represent either a \emph{ Medium}, an \emph{Artifact}, a \emph{Member} or a \emph{Network}.
A \emph{ Medium} can be a blog or a wiki.
The \emph{Artifact} would be an individual entry.
The \emph{Network} represents the community, in which the different \emph{Members} interact in.
\emph{Members} do not have to be human, but are assigned a specific role in the \emph{Network}.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=0.9\linewidth]{related_work/mediabase.png}
    \caption{Mediabase Overview \cite{Klam10e}}
\end{figure}
Furthermore, Mediabase includes \emph{Services}, like a \emph{Watcher} to inspect the data.
A Mediabase consists of a backend database, like DB2, or MySQL, crawler scripts, monitoring processes and a frontend for visualization of data and user interaction.

This approach is favorable for the management of large scale-free dynamic social graphs.

\section{Systems} \label{lab:systems}
This section describes existing systems which will be used for the realization of this project.

\subsection{Social Bot Framework}

The Social Bot Framework (SBF) is a Web-based model-driven near-realtime environment to develop chatbots \cite{NLKl19}. The model-driven development allows less experienced users to take part in the development, which is favorable for the creation of a chatbot inside a Community of Practice (CoP). The framework consists of a GUI to model the bot and define the actions, which it should perform, and a Social Bot Manager Service, which is used to deploy the bot.

\subsection{RASA}
Rasa is an open sourced framework for building chat- and voice-based bots. The goal of RASA is to bring current advances in machine-learning to end-users, such that they can create chatbots in a simple way \cite{BFPN17}. 
The RASA system is split into a component for natural language understanding (RASA NLU) and a dialogue management component (RASA Core).

RASA NLU is used to extract the \emph{intents} and intent \emph{entities} of a user message.
The \emph{intent} of a message represents the thing that the user tries to accomplish \footnotemark. 
Entities are keywords that are relevant to the current context.
Intent recognition is done by using a text classification based on the fastText approach \cite{BFPN17}. 
fastText has a similar accuracy to conventional deep learning classifiers, but is much faster and therefore more easily scalable \cite{JGBM16}.

\footnotetext{ 
  \href{https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/glossary\#intent}{Rasa: intents}}

RASA Core consists of a \emph{Tracker}, a \emph{Policy} and a set of \emph{Actions} \cite{BFPN17}. The Tracker manages the current state of the conversation. It gets an intent as an input and forwards it the Policy, which selects the next action, given the current state of the conversation and a predefined list of actions for each intent. The Action triggers the Tracker to recalculate the new state and might also send a reply to the user.

The system is built in a modularized way and each service provides HTTP APIs \cite{BFPN17}, which makes it possible to use the NLU component independantly of the rest of the framework. This makes it easy to integrate it into an existing system \cite{RaKe19}.



\subsection{las2peer}
las2peer is a disributed platform, which allows users to easily deploy their HTTP services. Each service is a node in the network and many nodes can form a peer-to-peer seed network, which communicate through standard protocols. Data storage and communications are encrypted, adding an extra layer of security to las2peer services. This allows even small communities to securely design and deploy las2peer services.

The las2peer platform contains the MobSOS framework, but not the CCA.

\subsection{GraphQL}
GraphQL\footnotemark is a query language specifation for web APIs.
\footnotetext{GraphQL: \href{https://graphql.github.io/}{https://graphql.github.io/}}
Instead of hitting multiple endpoints, like in standard REST APIs, for different requests, users can get all data from one endpoint, by specfifying the kind of data that they need as a query. This means that it prevents over- and underfetching of data.\footnotemark

\footnotetext{\href{https://www.howtographql.com/basics/1-graphql-is-the-better-rest}{https://www.howtographql.com/basics/1-graphql-is-the-better-rest}}

GraphQL does not mandate the use of a specific programming language, the actual implemtention is up to the developer of the server. \footnotemark
\footnotetext{\href{http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/}{http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/}}
Many different implemtentions have been written for programming languages like Java \footnote{Java GraphQL Library:\href{https://www.graphql-java.com/documentation/master/}{https://www.graphql-java.com/documentation/master/}} and Javascript. \footnote{Javascript GraphQL Library:\href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-graphql}{https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-graphql}}

Transforming an existing REST API into a GraphQL API can be a cumbersome task. An automation process in the form of a Wrapper has been proposed, which converts an existing schema such as a Swagger schema into a GraphQL schema\footnote{\href{https://github.com/yarax/swagger-to-graphql}{Swagger-to-GraphQL}}. Such a wrapper transforms GraphQL requests into RESTful requests as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:graphqlWrapper}.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{realization/graphqlWrapper.png}
    \caption{Example use of community Service with the Bot}
    \label{fig:graphqlWrapper}
\end{figure}

In GraphQL, data objects are defined as a \emph{type}. GraphQL provides simple base-types like Int Float, Boolean and String, but new types can also be defined. An example can be seen in \ref{lst:GraphQLType}.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Example of a GraphQL schema},captionpos=b,label={lst:GraphQLType}]
type Review {
  id: ID
  rating: Int
  description:String
}
\end{lstlisting}
New fields can be dynamically added without influencing existing queries. The schemas are formalized as either a \emph{Query }, or a \emph{Mutation}. They are declared by the keyword \emph{schema}. The query keyword can be omitted. An example of a query can be seen in listing \ref{lst:GraphQLQuery}.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Example of a GraphQL Query},captionpos=b,label={lst:GraphQLQuery}]
{
  Review(id: "1000") {
    rating
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
Here we access the rating of the review with the ID 1000.

Mutations are used to modify data. An example of a query can be seen in listing \ref{lst:GraphQLMut}.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Example of a GraphQL Mutation},captionpos=b,label={lst:GraphQLMut}]
mutation addReview(){
  {
	rating 
	description
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
