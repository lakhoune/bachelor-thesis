\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

\section{Summary}
In our work, we analyzed the impact of a chatbot on collaboration and success awareness in the community. We have developed a chatbot that provided community-related information and served as an interface for success modeling.  We have evaluated the chatbot in an existing community.

We found that the use of a chatbot increased the success awareness of the community. Users were able to inspect the visualizations without any further help.
We also found out that the bot increases contributions in the community. Contributions might further increase by other means like gamification. 
We confirmed that chatbots are favorable for quick and small tasks. Nonetheless, we noted that complex tasks were less intuitive and that intent recognition is challenging for complex sentence structures.

Thus we conclude that chatbots can be a great tool to assist a community and increases the success awareness of non-experienced users.
